# Final Project Progress Journal

In order to get the bcc docker running (from: https://github.com/zlim/bcc-docker) I needed to:

1. install a clean version of Ubuntu 18.04 on my Windows 10 Virtual Box
   1. did not work out-of-the-box with:
      1. ubuntu 20
      2. WLS2
      3. Arch
2. install docker with:
```
sudo apt install docker.io
```
3. install linux headers with:
```
sudo apt install linux-headers-`uname -r`
```
4. run the docker command with:
```
docker run -it --rm \
  --privileged \
  -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro \
  -v /usr/src:/usr/src:ro \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  --workdir /usr/share/bcc/tools \
  zlim/bcc
```
5. can compile my own with:
```
cd bcc-docker
mv Dockerfile.bionic Dockerfile
sudo docker image build -t my_bcc_docker .
sudo docker image ls
docker run -it --rm --privileged -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro -v /usr/src:/usr/src:ro -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro --workdir /usr/share/bcc/tools my_bcc_docker
```
6. to run an example use:
On the first terminal:
```
cd /usr/share/bcc/examples/
python hello_world.py
```
Next open another terminal in the host and run:
```
sudo docker container exec -it <CONTAINER ID> /bin/bash
```
Should print hello world with function trace in the first terminal

# Trying to make the examples work:
compiling bcc from scratch:
(following: https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md#ubuntu---source)
```
sudo apt-get -y install bison build-essential cmake flex git libedit-dev \
  libllvm6.0 llvm-6.0-dev libclang-6.0-dev python zlib1g-dev libelf-dev libfl-dev python3-distutils
git clone https://github.com/iovisor/bcc.git
mkdir bcc/build; cd bcc/build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
cmake -DPYTHON_CMD=python3 .. # build python3 binding
pushd src/python/
make
sudo make install
popd
```
Success! (shows up in the Dockerfile)

We now have on our machine the compiled bcc with working examples like:
```
amit@amit-VirtualBox:~/bcc/examples/networking/http_filter$ sudo python3 http-parse-simple.py -i lo
```
And on another terminal we can:
```
python3 -m http.server
```
And another terminal to run:
```
curl 0.0.0.0:8000
```

# Building Docker with our bcc build

After eternity, build with:
```
sudo docker image build -t my_bcc_docker .
```
Dockerfile contains the latest build config
Run docker with:
```
sudo docker run -it --rm --privileged -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro -v /usr/src:/usr/src:ro -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro -v /home/amit/final_project/proto2ebpf:/usr/share/proto2ebpf --network="host" --workdir /usr/share/bcc/examples my_bcc_docker
```
where the entry is: entrypoint.sh

## Docker compose

*probably uneeded compose because we use host as network to make our tests on loopback*

Install with:
```
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```
Run with:
```
docker-compose up
```

# Testing my repo

I started to write the proto2ebpf repo and I placed it here:
```
https://github.com/bergeramit/proto2ebpf.git
```

To run this simply clone the proto2ebpf to this folder and run the docker build and docker run command (I have included a sample of this repo here)

Now we will run this with the docker run with host network (since we want to test the ebpf works in our localhost):

```
# Build with:
sudo docker image build -t my_bcc_docker .

# Run with
sudo docker run -it --rm --privileged -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro -v /usr/src:/usr/src:ro -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro -v /home/amit/AdvanceOSFinalProject/proto2ebpf:/usr/share/proto2ebpf --network="host" --workdir /usr/share/proto2ebpf my_bcc_docker
```

# Final Build

Server with protobuf filter
```
sudo docker container exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> /bin/bash
python3.6 proto2ebpf.py --env=server_with_filter
```

Server without protobuf filter:
```
sudo docker container exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> /bin/bash
python3.6 proto2ebpf.py --env=server_without_filter
```

TO run a client against those servers
```
sudo docker container exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> /bin/bash
python3.6 proto2ebpf.py --env=client
```

# Results:

## The difference between server_without_filter and server_with_filter

The server_without_filter calls additional function to validate the packet (_process_with_container_filter) While the server_with_filter does not because this filter was already applied in the eBPF filter.

## Was the eBPF filter faster?

Measured the diff in time from the: "Started Session" log to the last "Hanlded!"

On 2000 packets send on loopback (half should be filtered out):

With eBPF filter: approx time is 44.5 seconds

Without eBPF filter: approx time is 45.3 seconds

### Possible Explanations

Unfourtunatly, results were inconclusive regarding the benefit of using eBPF.
This can come from the fact that the current eBPF rule is very simple and does not save alot of cycles in the process. In addition, the need to log/ time from within the system (was done for simplictic reasons) might effect the processing time, since printing is a very intensive functionality.

# Retrospective

In retrospective I think I would have gone to probably imlementing the protobuf rules to instructions intead of the BCC framework C code because I thinks that would have given me the ability to implement advance rules without unreadable error messages when trying to load the eBPF.
Although I must say that probably the BCC is right for the timefram of this project because implementing a compiler in a few weeks with the load, backend and everything BCC takes care for would have been a real challenge.
This project for one person in the time frame, to me, was alot more complicated than expected.


# Summary

I have learned alot about the use of eBPFs as socket filters, the BCC framework, debugging compiled eBPFs, protobuf, protobuf's encodings and that timing differences is super hard to measure!
This has been an amazing opportunity for me to develop a full sized project's POC (lol) including containers to run client/ server, simple compiler from basic protobuf rules to eBPFs and loading that and trying to time it.

I hope this repo and the proto2ebpf repo will help developers who are just getting started with eBPFs and BCC framework as I provided a simple guide to get started on you clena Ubuntu 18.04.
